**#Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Portfolio**
Welcome to my collection of algorithm implementations for Design and Analysis of Algorithms.
This repository demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and analyze algorithms in Java across graph theory, dynamic programming, and combinatorial optimization.

**Implementations**
** 1. Bellman-Ford Shortest Path**
File: Bellman.java
Topic: Graph Algorithms
Description: Implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths. Detects negative cycles and reconstructs shortest paths.
Key Skills: Relaxation, negative cycle detection, path reconstruction.
Complexity: O(n * m)

** 2. Drone Frequency Assignment → 3-SAT Reduction**
File: Drones.java
Topic: Reductions & NP-Completeness
Description: Reduces the Drone Frequency Problem to a 3-SAT instance. Models real-world wireless frequency conflicts as SAT constraints.
Key Skills: Problem reduction, satisfiability encoding, CNF clause generation.

 3. Power Grid Expansion (Modified MST)
File: Expansion.java
Topic: Greedy Algorithms & Graph Optimization
Description: Modified Prim’s MST to determine the minimum cost of powering all nodes when each can either build a plant (z) or connect via edges.
Key Skills: MST with custom cost function, greedy decision-making.

** 4. Priority Edge Detection in Network Flow**
File: Flow.java
Topic: Network Flow
Description: Uses Ford-Fulkerson (Edmonds-Karp BFS) to compute max flow, then identifies priority edges where increasing capacity improves overall flow.
Key Skills: Residual graphs, augmenting paths, bottleneck analysis.

** 5. Maximum Revenue from Cutting Mousepads (2D DP)**
File: Mousepads.java
Topic: Dynamic Programming
Description: Generalizes the rod cutting problem to 2D: maximize revenue from cutting a rectangular sheet into mousepads with given price table.
Key Skills: DP table filling, recursion over horizontal/vertical cuts.

** 6. NotUnited: Bipartite Graph Realization from Degree Sequences**
File: NotUnited.java
Topic: Graph Theory (Degree Sequences)
Description: Given degree sequences A and B, determines if a valid bipartite graph exists and constructs an adjacency matrix if possible.
Key Skills: Greedy heap allocation, bipartite graph construction.

** 7. Range Count with Binary Search**
File: Range.java
Topic: Searching & Binary Search Variants
Description: Counts the number of elements in a sorted array within range [x, y] using two binary searches.
Key Skills: Lower/upper bound binary search, range queries.


**Tech & Skills Demonstrated**
Languages: Java
Algorithms: Graph algorithms, shortest paths, MST, max-flow, reductions to SAT, dynamic programming, binary search.
